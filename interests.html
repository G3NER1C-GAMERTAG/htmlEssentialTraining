    <h3>Watching movies</h3>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I sometimes wanted nothing more than to sit down and watch a good movie. Whether it be a comedy, action film, science fiction, whatever's there, I'd probably watch it. Movies like The Lego Movie, Spider-Man, and pretty much any Pixar movie before 2015 have all played a big part in what movies I want to dig into,even if the films I watch typically aren't within some sort of cultural zeitgeist.</p>

    <h3>Acting</h3>

    <p>Ever since Canton did their rendition of <i>Murder's In The Heir</i> in fall of 2023, a long dormant passion of mine was reawakened. Watching movies made me want to act for a time, but I was discouraged after doing some obligatory play in elementary that I honestly don't remember much. Time passed and I saw the play. That was when I realized that I wanted to act again. So when auditions for the musical, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> rolled along, I went and I got in. I had a small role with only 2 speaking lines, but that didn't matter too much to me. The next two years, I auditioned, played, auditioned, played, so on. Now I'm an inducted member of Thespian Troupe 259.</p>

     <h3>Playing video games</h3>

     <p>Perhaps a common trait among people of my generation, but without games like Halo 4, Lego Marvel Superheroes, and Lego Star Wars, I'm not sure I'd have as much an interest in games as I do now. The feeling of being in control of something is never not a pleasure, and the added challenge is definitely a way to keep me on my toes. Fun fact, playing video games can actually benefit you, by enhancing your hand-eye coordination. Sometimes, a somewhat tamer, narrative-driven experience is good after hecitc days.</p>
