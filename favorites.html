        <h3>Things of which I call my favorite.</h3>
       
        <h4>Films</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Lego Movie (2014)</li>
            <li>Tron: Legacy (2010)</li>
            <li>Star Trek (2009)</li>
            <li>The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)</li>
            <li>Avatar (2009)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any time I wanna sit down and relax, 9 times out of 10, I'll put on a movie I enjoy. Movies like Tron: Legacy, Star Trek, and The Lego Movie are all about people who venture to another world to stop a threat bigger than themselves, Avatar is a visual and audible spectacle ahead of its time, and The Amazing Spider-Man is an example of reboots done right, something rarely seen in Hollywood these days.</p>

        <h4>Video Games</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Detroit: Become Human</li>
            <li>Halo: Reach</li>
            <li>Halo 4</li>
            <li>God of War (2018)</li>
            <li>Lego Marvel Superheroes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want a thought-provoking and interactive story where your decisions truly have consequences, then play Detroit: Become Human. Halo: Reach gives a realistic and somewhat bleak take on what war really is. God of War is the kind of father-son journey one would want to make in a movie, and Halo 4 & Lego Marvel are modern classics.</p>
        
        <h4>Books</h4>
        
        <p>If truth be told, I don't really read often enough to make a full list,which is why I made a Video Games list instead. But I will say that I enjoyed the Giver Quartet because of its branching story, science-fiction and dystopian theme, and philosophical questions about humanity.</p>

        <h4>Foods</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken/Fettuchini Alfredo</li>
            <li>Spaghetti and Meatballs</li>
            <li>Pizza</li>
            <li>Lo Mein</li>
            <li>Mashed Potatoes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pasta is generally my favorite, so I could never turn down a plate of spaghetti or alfredo. Pizza is great for parties and special occasions. Mashed potatoes work as an exceptional side dish, and Lo Mein because the Chinese really know what they're doing.</p>

        <h4>Obligatory Factoid</h4>
        <p>I own all of those movies, except Star Trek, on Blu-ray 3D, a format kickstarted by Avatar's success. Sadly, the hype died in 2017, and it's nothing than more than a lost art.</p>
