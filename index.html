        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>My name is Ethan King. Right now, I am an 11th grade student in Canton Central School, where I spend my time acting in the school plays. At BOCES, I'm taking the Computer and Information Sciences course. I like the idea of programming things. Watching is your creation comes to life via several lines of code is a pleasure.</p>
        <p>In this course at BOCES, we are learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So far, I don't really have a favorite language, but I like seeing both CSS and HTML in play as they give the site that they are programming their characteristics. While I realize that maybe computer programming is no longer something I'm dead set on, I still want to give it a chance because I really like where this is going to go.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I like to participate in the school plays and musicals, play video games, and watch movies and TV shows. Most of which, I watch with my dad, beacause... bonding. \(^O^)/</p>
